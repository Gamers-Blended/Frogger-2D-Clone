## Gameplay
### Board
![Board](https://github.com/Gamers-Blended/Frogger-2D-Clone/blob/master/Files%20for%20ReadMe/Board.PNG)

The objective is to lead 5 frogs to the 5 home bays at the end of the game board. <br>
Each home bay can only be occupied by 1 frog. <br>
The player wins when all 5 home bays are occupied by 5 different frogs! <br>

Avoid the vehicles on the road. <br>
Hop onto a turtle or log to get across the river. <br>
Note that the turtles in blue are either surfacing (will turn to brown) or diving into the river (will disappear).

To start the game, press Enter. <br>
Players will gain control of the frog once the start game sound ends.

### Controls
Press Enter to start startup sound. <b>
Use the arrow keys to move the frog.

## Bugs
Upon winning a level and restarting it using Enter, the home bays are still marked as occupied. Hence the frogs aren't able to stay in the home bays.
